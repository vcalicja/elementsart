# Netlify Build Fix

## The Issue
Netlify build failed with "could not resolve entry module client index html" error.

## SOLUTION âœ…

### Method 1: Use Updated netlify.toml (Recommended)
The netlify.toml file has been updated with the correct build configuration:
```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  command = "npm install && npx vite build"
  publish = "dist/public"
```

**Just redeploy your site** - the netlify.toml file will handle everything automatically.

### Method 2: Manual Settings in Netlify Dashboard
If Method 1 doesn't work, manually set these in your Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Click "Site settings" â†’ "Build & deploy"
3. Update build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm install && npx vite build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Base directory**: leave empty

### Method 3: Alternative Build Commands
If you still have issues, try these build commands in Netlify:

**Option A:**
```bash
npm install && NODE_ENV=production npx vite build
```

**Option B:**
```bash
npm ci && npx vite build --mode production
```

**Option C:**
```bash
npm install && npx vite build --base ./
```

## Why This Happens
The error occurs because:
1. Vite needs to find the `client/index.html` file as the entry point
2. The build process needs to know where to output files (`dist/public`)
3. Dependencies need to be installed first (`npm install`)

## Test Locally First
Before deploying, test the build locally:
```bash
npm install
npx vite build
```
Check that the `dist/public` folder contains:
- `index.html`
- `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files
- All your images and videos

## File Structure After Build
```
dist/
â””â”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].css
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index-[hash].js
    â””â”€â”€ [your media files]
```

## If It Still Fails
1. Check build logs in Netlify for specific error messages
2. Verify all files are committed to your GitHub repository
3. Try Method 2 (manual settings) if Method 1 doesn't work
4. Contact me if you need further assistance

Your site should deploy successfully now! ðŸš€
