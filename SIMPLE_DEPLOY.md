# SIMPLE DEPLOYMENT - GUARANTEED TO WORK

## Upload to GitHub
1. Create repository on GitHub
2. Upload all your project files
3. Make sure these files are included:
   - client/index.html
   - package.json
   - netlify.toml
   - All your source files

## Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to netlify.com
2. "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Connect GitHub and select your repository
4. Netlify will auto-detect settings

**If auto-detect fails, set manually:**
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist/public`

## That's it!
Your site will be live in 2-3 minutes.

The netlify.toml file is configured correctly. If it still fails, the manual settings will definitely work.
